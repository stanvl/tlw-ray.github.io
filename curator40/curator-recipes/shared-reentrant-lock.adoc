= 共享可重入锁

== 说明

完全分布的全局同步锁，意味着任何时间的快照，没有两个客户端认为它们拥有相同的锁。

== 参与类

    InterProcessMutex

== 用法

=== 创建一个InterProcessMutex
[source, java]
----
public InterProcessMutex(CuratorFramework client,
                         String path)
Parameters:
client - client
path - the path to lock
----

== 一般用法

要获取锁，请使用以下方法之一：

[source, java]
----
public void acquire()
Acquire the mutex - blocking until it's available. Note: the same thread can call acquire
re-entrantly. Each call to acquire must be balanced by a call to release()
----

[source, java]
----
public boolean acquire(long time,
                       TimeUnit unit)
Acquire the mutex - blocks until it's available or the given time expires. Note: the same thread can
call acquire re-entrantly. Each call to acquire that returns true must be balanced by a call to release()

Parameters:
time - time to wait
unit - time unit
Returns:
true if the mutex was acquired, false if not
----

要释放互斥量，请调用：

[source, java]
----
public void release()
Perform one release of the mutex if the calling thread is the same thread that acquired it. If the
thread had made multiple calls to acquire, the mutex will still be held when this method returns.
----

.注意
[NOTE]
====
InterProcessMutex实例是可重用的。 即不要每次都创建一个新的实例。 重新使用单个实例。
====

== 撤销

InterProcessMutex支持ZooKeeper用法wiki中描述的合作撤销机制。

要使互斥可撤销，请调用：

[source, java]
----
public void makeRevocable(RevocationListener<T> listener)
Make the lock revocable. Your listener will get called when another process/thread wants you to release the lock. Revocation is cooperative.
Parameters:
listener - the listener
----

要求锁撤销/释放，请使用Revoker类中的静态方法：

[source, java]
----
public static void attemptRevoke(CuratorFramework client,
                                 String path)
                         throws Exception
Utility to mark a lock for revocation. Assuming that the lock has been registered
with a RevocationListener, it will get called and the lock should be released. Note,
however, that revocation is cooperative.
Parameters:
client - the client
path - the path of the lock - usually from something like InterProcessMutex.getParticipantNodes()
----

== 错误处理

强烈建议您添加一个ConnectionStateListener并观察SUSPENDED和LOST状态更改。 如果报告了SUSPENDED状态，则无法确定您仍然保持锁定状态，除非您随后收到RECONNECTED状态。 如果报告了LOST状态，则确定您不再持有该锁。
